How to easily implement biometric authentication in your app

## Introduction

In 2017 Apple launched its new top tier smartphone model: iPhone X.
Unlike previous models, it has a full-frame screen without a bezel (except for a notch). Due to this radical change, the home button also disappears and with it fingerprint security authentication.
But Apple is not crazy. They introduced a sophisticated new method to secure access to our smartphone: Face ID.
Face ID is a facial recognition system that works thanks to three different hardware sensors: a dot projector, a flood illuminator, and an infrared camera. The resultant map is compared with the pregistered face â€” if the two faces match, the user is authenticated. The system works well, even with glasses, hat, facial hair, and make up.
